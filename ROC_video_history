CALL FOR COLLABORATION AND ALLIES - The Republic Of Conscience

Information Paper: 
HOW THE BLOCKCHAIN SAVED THE WORLD

To begin what I hope will be our long-term collaborative effort, I'm posting videos below for people to look at and get a sense of what our Republic Of Conscience project is about.

Hopefully the videos and text will illustrate not only the urgent need but also the great opportunity to test the new SDG Coin /Token as a solution to the www.17PlusONE.com Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.




EXCITING AND IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL EFFORT
This holiday season I'm looking for SUPPORT - to assemble an international team of individuals and organizations that care deeply about this subject that touches all our lives. I'm hoping self-leaders will step forward to become www.BLOCKCHAINallies.com and www.BLOCKCHAINcollaborators.com , lending their passion and expertise to finding BLOCKCHAIN-based solutions that are both commercially viable and humanitarian.



HIGH LEVEL PROMOTION
You will see from videos and websites associated with this project that it has been under development for over 10 years in China, involving many local and regional governments, organizations and thousands of individuals. Recently our civil society participation at the historic Paris Climate Conference in 2015 and again this year in Marrakesh Morocco has resulted in exposure of our project to the highest levels of officials and public relations personnel of the UN and many other local, national and international organizations.



BREAKTHROUGH YEAR
Many good and bad things are happening in the world and we believe that because of its unique features, 2017 will be the BLOCKCHAIN breakthrough year, especially for the "3rd sector", providing collaborators and allies with a first-mover-advantage, as pioneers in this revolutionary space. Since its launch by the UN last year, the SDG Global Goals have inspired the Republic Of Conscience to develop a platform to invite allies and collaborators to profit from solving the urgent Global Goals.

Our concept is well known in the Chinese BLOCKCHAIN community  and  now it's time to assemble the fantastic resources available here and get to work sharing the opportunity for fun, profit and creating a new world and Lifestyle Of Health, Happiness And Sustainability for everyone.
